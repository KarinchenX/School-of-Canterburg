# GoToStore #
GoToStore is a testing game I made to get experience in using SugarCube/Tweego in Visual Studio.


Todo-Abriged:
Make some kind of gameloop
Write down what the games scope will be

Versions: 
0.0 - nothing done edition
- created first file structure, arrays, user input, pages/rooms, initialization
- got very very basic understanding about of how to write SugarCube code
